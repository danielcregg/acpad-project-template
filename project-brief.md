# ACPAD Final Project

## üì± Project Overview
For this project you are required to design and develop an Ionic Angular app using the latest Ionic version and the latest Angular Version. The project must consist of standalone components only. Your application must be selected from the Final Project App Choice List on the Moodle page. The application will be like the applications we developed in labs but with improved design and extended functionality.

## ‚ö° Minimum Project Requirments
- This application must be developed using GitHub Codespaces.
- You must use the Project GitHub Repository provided to you on the Moodle page. No other development set up will be acceptable. This repository can be found under the Final Project Assessment section on Moodle. You need to click on a link to create the repository. This repository will contain all documentation, application code and any resources (e.g., input and output files, images etc) used by your application. Please note, no materials outside of your GitHub repository are gradable. Using another GitHub repository or not using GitHub at all for this project will get a penalty of 60%. If you do not understand what is meant by this, then email me before you begin your project.
- Project development must be tracked on GitHub via regular commits. Your GitHub repository must have at minimum two commits per week, if not I may contact you for a live project demonstration. The project will be capped at 40% if you fail to attend this meeting.    
- The README file should contain clear instructions for compiling, deploying, and running the application. It should also briefly outline the nature of the project and detail the set of features it contains. All sections of the README template must be filled out and add more sections if you please. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Minimum Feature Requirements
- Standalone components
- Angular Router navigation
- Custom service implementation
- Backend as a Service (BaaS) integration (Firebase/SupaBase)
- AI integration
- Capacitor native plugin integration
- 5+ Ionic UI components

### üìù Coding Standards
- Clean, compilable, and executable code
- Consistent code formatting
- Comprehensive documentation through comments
  - Class-level documentation
  - Method-level documentation
  - Variable-level documentation
- Proper error handling
- Adherence to Angular/Ionic best practices and use of latest Angular tools (e.g. @if and @for)

## ‚≠ê Enhanced Features
To achieve a higher grade, consider implementing:
- Additional design features not seen in labs
- Additional functionality not seen in labs
- Progressive Web App (PWA) implementation
- App store deployment

## üìä Project Submission Process
You must folow this subission process carefully. If you miss any part, especially the screencast, you will be penalised.    

### 1. Screencast Demonstration
- 5-minute screen recording using [MS Stream](https://www.microsoft365.com/launch/stream)
- Give a brief code walkthrough highlghting places where you expended most of your effort.
- Demonstrate your code running and its operation.  
- Highlight any additional functionality you implemented. This is where you can pick up extra marks.  

### 2. Moodle Submission
- Download a copy of your final Git repository from the GitHub website.
- Upload this zip file under the submission link on Moodle. You can find the submission link under the Final Project section on the Moodle page.
- Submit the zip file to Moodle before the due date. The due date can be found by clicking on the submission link on Moodle. Late submissions will incur a 10% penalty per day. 
- In the submission area on Moodle, where you upoad your project, you will see a text box in which you will be able to enter text. Put the URL link to your project GitHub repository and the URL link to your MS Streams screencast recording you created.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
1. Only materials within this GitHub repository will be graded
2. Using alternative repositories will incur a 60% penalty
3. Insufficient commits may require a live demonstration (40% grade cap if missed)
4. Late submissions incur a 10% penalty per day
5. Documentation outside the README.md will not be graded
